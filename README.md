# Portainer - The Complete Guide

Portainer Community Edition is a lightweight service delivery platform for containerized applications that can be used to manage Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and ACI environments. It is designed to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. The application allows you to manage all your orchestrator resources (containers, images, volumes, networks and more) through a â€˜smartâ€™ GUI and/or an extensive API.

Portainer consists of a single container that can run on any cluster. It can be deployed as a Linux container or a Windows native container.

Portainer Business Edition builds on the open-source base and includes a range of advanced features and functions (like RBAC and Support) that are specific to the needs of business users.

In this guide we will cover all my favorite features of Portainer: both CE (Community Edition) and BE (Business Edition).

**Note** Portainer BE is **FREE** for everyone if your cluster has less than 5 nodes. So feel free to start off with all the extra features for that lovely price of ðŸ†“.
